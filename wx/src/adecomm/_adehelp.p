PROCEDURE:
    _adehelp.p

PURPOSE:
    Procedure to access the PROGRESS Online Help System. ADE tools run this
    this procedure to provide users with online help.

SYNTAX
    RUN adecomm/_adehelp.p
        (INPUT  p_HelpID,
         INPUT  p_HelpCommand,
         INPUT  p_ContextNumber,
         INPUT  p_SearchString).

DESCRIPTION:
    
    1. Help File ID's and ADE Tool Names
  
        For the purpose of accessing help, PROGRESS uses unique help id
        strings to identify help files. The PROGRESS ADE tool help files
        are identified this way - where the help id string is a tool name.
        For example, some tool names from the PROGRESS ADE toolset are:

            User Interface Builder  :   uib
            Procedure Editor        :   edit
            Data Dictionary         :   dict
            
        In addition to the ADE tools, PROGRESS can identify other types of
        help files using a unique help id string. Some PROGRESS examples:
        
            ADM Reference Help      :   adm
            Language Reference Help :   lgrf
            Common Directory Help   :   comm
            
        The help id string is used as part of the help file name,
        which is described in "Naming of PROGRESS Help Files" below.

    2. Location of PROGRESS Help Files
    
        PROGRESS help files are located in the DLC/prohelp directory.
        
    3. Naming of PROGRESS Help Files
        
        To support help files for different tools and multiple languages,
        PROGRESS help file names are composed of the help id (p_HelpID)
        and the first three letters of a language. _adehelp.p determines
        the language name using the 4GL CURRENT-LANGUAGE function.
        
        For example, the PROGRESS UIB English help file is uibeng.hlp and
        is located in the DLC/prohelp directory.
        
        For portability across operating system, help file names are
        lowercase.
    
INPUT PARAMETERS:
    
    p_HelpID
        A character string identifying the PROGRESS ADE tool whose help
        file you want to access.
        
    p_HelpCommand
        A character string identifying the SYSTEM-HELP command you want
        to execute.
        
        This procedure processes the following help commands:
        
            HELP    Displays the contents of the system How to Use Help
                    file.
            
            CONTEXT Displays the help topic that the context number parameter
                    p_ContextNumber identifies.
                    
            CONTENTS
                    Displays the help contents help screen for the specified
                    ADE tool.

            TOPICS  Displays the Help Topics dialog box for the specified
                    ADE tool.

            KEY     Displays the help topic matching the p_SearchString
                    string found in the help file's keyword list. If there
                    is more than one match, it displays the first topic
                    containing the keyword. If there is no match or the
                    string is omitted, a message is displayed indicating
                    that the keyword is invalid.

            PARTIAL-KEY
                    Displays the help topic matching the p_SearchString
                    string found in the help file's keyword list. If there
                    is more than one match, no match, or if the string is
                    omitted, it displays the Search dialog box.

            QUIT    Informs the help application that help is no longer
                    required.
        

    p_ContextNumber
        An integer identifying the SYSTEM-HELP context number. It identifies
        a unique help topic within a help file.

        If called with a p_ContextNumber = ? using p_HelpCommand = CONTEXT,
        an alert-box message is displayed indicating an invalid value.

    p_SearchString
        A character string identifying a keyword or partial keyword in a
        desired help file.
        
        If called with p_SearchString = ? using p_HelpCommand = KEY or
        PARTIAL-KEY, an alert-box message is displayed indicating an
        invalid value.

    
OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    None

    See the PROGRESS SYSTEM-HELP Statement in the Language Reference
    manual or online help for more information.
    
    The _kwhelp.p procedure invokes PROGRESS Online Language Reference Help
    to search for keyword help on code selected in an editor widget. You
