This sample demonstrates the Addsoft Schedule control (schedocx.ocx).   

It is a vacation scheduling program, and consists of five windows, vacation.w, emps.w, 
empinfo.w, vaclist.w, and vacinfo.w.  Vacation.w is the main window.  

You can click the icons in the upper left of the window to get different views of the data. 
You can edit the schedule by double-clicking on existing items in the schedule or by
using the Edit->Vacations dialog-box.  You can also add or change employees by using the
Edit->Employees dialog-box.  You can also see a report of scheduled time blocks
for each employee by clicking the down arrow next to the employee name in the Employee view.

The schedule is automatically saved in vactb.txt and vacres.txt when the program is exited.

You must have the Schedule control installed on your machine in order to run this sample.
