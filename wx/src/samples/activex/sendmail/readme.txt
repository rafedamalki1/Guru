This sample demonstrates the use of the Microsoft Common Dialog controls (comdlg32.ocx), a 
Crescent Internet Toolpak mail control (cimail.ocx), and the Crescent ListBox control
(CSList.ocx).

You can customize the look of the dialog by selecting the "Set Color" and/or "Set Font" 
buttons.  Each brings up a Microsoft Common Dialog.  The "Set Font" button sets the font 
for the "Send Message To" list.

Fill in the "Host Name", "Mail List" and "Sender" fields.  You can enter a distribution 
list or a single recipient in the "Mail List" fill-in field.  Then press the 
"Fill Mail List" button.  This goes to the host server and retrieves the email addresses 
for the mail list specified.

Select an address from the "Send Message To" list, enter a message and press "Send Mail".

You must have the specified controls installed on your machine in order to run this
sample.
