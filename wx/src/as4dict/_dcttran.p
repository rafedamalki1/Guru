Description:
   The main dictionary transaction loop.  It also contains the wait-for
   block for when we are in browse mode.  In either case, this is only
   run when the current dictionary database is connected and we can
   therefore look at it's schema.

   This is separated from dictg.p so that all references to metaschema
   files (i.e., all database references) have a place to be scoped to,
   namely this .p.  This way they can stay around as long as we're 
   dealing with a single database.  When we switch databases, or disconnect
   a database, we have to return to main temporarily so that Progress can
   clean up after itself with respect to that database.  Then this procedure
   can be reentered for a new database.

              03/25/96 D. McMann Changed QUESTION to WARNING
              06/17/96 D. McMann Changed process for syncing client.  
              09/30/96 D. McMann Changed how files are verified for having
                                 fields and leaving transaction blook after
                                 sync.
              07/14/97 D. McMann Placed sync outside of transaction loop
