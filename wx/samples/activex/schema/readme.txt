This sample demonstrates the use of the Microsoft ListView, TreeView, TabStrip and 
ImageList controls (comctl32.ocx).

First you get a window containing a TabStrip control.  A ListView control has been
placed on the first tab which shows a set of icons, one for each table in the sports 
database.  If you click on one of these, a dialog-box will come up showing all of the 
records in that table in a ListView report.

A TreeView control has been placed on the second tab of the TabStrip control.  If you click 
on this tab, you will see the schema for the sports database.  Tables, fields, indexes and
sequences are shown as you expand the nodes of the tree.

The specified Microsoft common controls must be installed on your machine in order to run
this sample.  You must also connect to a sports database before running this sample.
