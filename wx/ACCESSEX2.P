The Following ADO Code should do the trick. The client will have to have
the latest MDAC and Jet components installed on their machine. Reference
MSDN for more information on ADO Recordset and Connection objects.

/*BEGIN CODE*/
def var conCurrent as com-handle no-undo. 
def var rstCurrent as com-handle no-undo.

/*Create an ADO Connection */
create "adodb.connection" conCurrent. 

/*Open the Connection, connect to an access database using the jet oledb
driver*/
conCurrent:open("Provider = Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;
Data Source=X:DIRECTORYDBNAME.mdb",
"", "", -1).

/*Create the recordset*/
create "adodb.recordset" rstCurrent. 

/*open the recodset, selecting the table TABLENAME from the database
specified in the connection concurrent*/

rstCurrent:open("TABLENAME", conCurrent, 3, 3, -1).

/*if there are records left, delete them*/
do while rstcurrent:recordcount > 0:
rstcurrent.movefirst.
rstcurrent.delete.
end.

/*add new record*/
rstCurrent:AddNew.
/* assign a value to one of the fields*/
rstCurrent:fields("FIELDNAME"):value = JobHead.JobNum.
rstCurrent:Update.
/*Cleanup*/
rstcurrent:close.
release object rstCurrent.
release object concurrent.
