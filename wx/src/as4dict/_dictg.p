Author: Laura Stern

Date Created: 01/28/92 
    Modified: 12/20/94 D. McMann NHorn had started in 11/94    
              12/26/95 D. McMann  added cancel logic to run tool to close bug
                           95-10-20-014
              03/25/96 D. McMann Changed QUESTION to WARNING in messages  
              06/19/96 D. McMann Changed s_CurrDb so Dictionary Library
                                 displayed instead of logical db name   
              09/30/96 D. McMann Changed how files are checked to verify
                                 all have at least 1 field defined.   
              12/03/96 D. McMann Changed size of logo frame for change in font
                                 in 82  
              07/14/97 D. McMann Placed sync outside of transaction loop
