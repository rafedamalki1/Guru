This sample demonstrates the MCI control (mci32.ocx) that comes with Visual Basic 5.0.  

The project shows three different movie clips in the .AVI format.  Three push buttons 
are used to select what movie clip is shown.  You must first select a clip before the MCI 
control becomes active.  Once the MCI control is active, the buttons on the control will
be enabled.  You can manipulate the clip (play, stop, rewind, etc) through
the MCI control.  You can select a different clip at anytime, but must push the play 
button on the MCI control to activate it.

The MCI control must be installed on your machine before running this sample.
