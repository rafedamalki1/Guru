File: as4sync.p

Description:
   This procedure is for application developers to use for syncing AS/400 schema from
   their application without the user having to have access to the Data Admin tool.
   The procedure that is called is the same procedure which will be run if Synchronize 
   PROGRESS/400 Client utility is run from that tool without any I/O.  This procedure is 
   necessary to set all shared variables as new and to create the alias which can not 
   be created in the same procedure that uses the alias. 
   
   Rules:
      1.  The AS/400 database MUST be connected.  This is because you can not define
            an alias on a database which is not connected.   The calling procedure must
            pass the name of the database which you want to sync.
                Example:  RUN as4sync.p (INPUT "dbname").             
                
            If the INPUT parameter database is not connected, then this procedure will not 
            call as4dict/as4_sync.p.
                
       2.  There is no I/O to the user except in the following cases:
                a.  Someone is defining schema and a sync can not be performed.     
                b.  Trying to use the syncing procedure on an AS/400 that does not
                       have any schema defined.       
                       
        3.  This procedure must be compiled with "dlc/src" in the propath.  If PROGRESS
             was installed in a directory other than "dlc", than that directory plus "src" must
             be added.

                       would not sync if two schema holders were connected.
