This project demonstrates the use of the Apex True DBGrid control (tdbg32.ocx).

The sample fills the grid with records from the customer table in the sports database.  
The records are retrieved on demand, when the grid is first displayed and then as the user 
scrolls.

The specified control must be installed on your machine in order to run this sample.
You must also connect to the sports database before running this sample.
