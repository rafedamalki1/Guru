Hi,

Strange as it sounds, i;m trying to update a MS Access database, Access 97,
from a progress frontend.

The code i have works the first time in the sense it adds the record to the
access database, but everytime i try to add another i get this error. Has
anyone else had any problems with doing this, also any example code would
help although as i say my code works the first time.

Error occurred while accessing component property/method:findfirst.
The microsoft jet database engine does not recognise 'MICK' as a valid field
name or expression.
Error code: 0x80020009 MSAccessGet c: empp61171cf.ab (5890).

I'm using progress 9.1B.

My Code.

Procedure MSACCESSConnect:

CREATE "Access.Application.8" lh-access.

/** Hide Access **/
lh-access:VISIBLE = NO.

/** Open database in shared mode **/
lh-db = lh-access:dbengine:opendatabase(Params.db-name).

/** Connect to Customer Table **/
lh-table = lh-db:openrecordset("Customers",2,,).

END PROCDURE.

PROCEDURE MSAccesssGet:

lh-table:findfirst("CustNo = " + Customer.CustNo:SCREEN-VALUE IN FRAME
default-frame + " AND " +
"BranchNo = " + Customer.CustNo:SCREEN-VALUE IN FRAME
default-frame).

PROCEDURE END.

PROCEDURE MSAccessUpdate:

DEF VAR lv-i AS INT.
DEF VAR hitem AS HANDLE.

IF lv-mode = "A" THEN
DO: RUN MSAccessGet.

IF NOT lh-table:nomatch THEN
DO: MESSAGE "Account Code/Branch Code combinatin already exists."
VIEW-AS ALERT-BOX.
RETURN NO-APPLY.
END.
END.

IF (lv-mode = "C" OR lv-mode = "D") AND lh-table:nomatch THEN
DO: MESSAGE "System Error, contact your System Administrator"
VIEW-AS ALERT-BOX.
RETURN NO-APPLY.
END.

IF lv-mode = "A" THEN
lh-table:addnew.

IF lv-mode = "C" THEN
lh-table:edit.

IF lv-mode = "A" OR lv-mode = "C" THEN
DO: DO lv-i = 1 TO BUFFER Customer:NUM-FIELDS:
ASSIGN hItem = BUFFER Customer:BUFFER-FIELD(lv-i).

ASSIGN lh-table:FIELDS(hItem:NAME):VALUE = hItem:Buffer-value.
END.
lh-table:UPDATE(,).
END.

IF lv-mode = "D" THEN
lh-table:DELETE.

release object lh-table.
END PROCEDURE.

Hi there Paul,

Have you tried releasing all of the com-handles that you have created? (lh-db, lh-table and lh-access) If you try and run the code a second time and try and create com-handles that are still active it will error.

Also, are the custno and branchno fields integers or character? If they are character you will have to run the findfirst with quotes around the field values.

HTH,

James.
